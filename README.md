1) LRFpertgrp1.R and LRFpertgrp2.R run the codes for the two examples from the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03021) simulation case 2.
2) FBPFA-PFA.R has the function PFA() that can fit both Full-Bayes version or you can specify alpha too.
3) applicationOF_FBPFA.R provides an example usage of above fn.
